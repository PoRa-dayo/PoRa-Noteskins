# Noteskin workshop links
This archive does not contain the noteskins from the Noteskin Workshops I've released. Most of these are 3D ports of existing noteskins. You can check them in their respective links.

# Description
An archive for all the noteskins I've released.

## Celable (NotITG/ITGmania/Outfox/Etterna)
*[Supports lifts]*
It's the "Scalable" noteskin that uses the gradients of the original "Cel" noteskin included with OpenITG/NotITG's download for its shell, combined with some HD sprites taken from [HURG's Cel Noteskin Workshop](https://github.com/HURG-IIDX/Noteskin-Workshop-Cel-and-Metal).

*The tap notes, mines and lifts of Celable have an alternate shell (originated from the "cel2d" noteskin) that can be activated by changing the filename of the "(RENAME ME TO ACTIVATE)" textures to the corresponding correct filename. For example, to activate the alternate tap note shell, you can rename "Tap Note parts (mipmaps).png" to something else, then rename "Tap Note parts ALT (RENAME ME TO ACTIVATE).png" to "Tap Note parts (mipmaps).png".*

## Cyber-border (NotITG)
It's the "Cyber" noteskin but with a contrasting border to allow more readability in modcharts. It's a bit crudely made but it gets the job done.

## Dividebyzero-half (NotITG)
One-sided version of the custom DivideByZero noteskin made for NotITG by leppy. The original 3D+ (two-sided) version can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9JmsQXlJ5w). I only sawed the arrow and mine model in half and made no further changes, so they will still be a bit visible at the back.

## enchantment-3d (ITGmania)
A 3D version of the original Enchantment noteskin (a noteskin that's bundled with ITGMania's download). I did not port the entire Enchantment workshop for ITGMania, only the default variant, so here it is.

## enchantment-3d+ (ITGmania)
A two-sided version of "enchantment-3d", for the sake of it looking good with the Twirl mod.
