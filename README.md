# Description
An archive for all the noteskins I've released.

## Celable (NotITG)
It's the "Scalable" noteskin that uses the gradients of the original "Cel" noteskin for its shell, combined with some HD sprites taken from [HURG's Cel Noteskin Workshop](https://github.com/HURG-IIDX/Noteskin-Workshop-Cel-and-Metal).

A direct 2D port of the Composite 4k noteskin by [Haley Halcyon](https://2gd4.me/otoge/noteskin/).

## Cyber-border (NotITG)
It's the "Cyber" noteskin but with a contrasting border to allow more readability in modcharts. It's a bit crudely made but it gets the job done.

## Dividebyzero-half (NotITG)
One-sided version of the custom DivideByZero noteskin made for NotITG by leppy. The original 3D+ (two-sided) version can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9JmsQXlJ5w). I only sawed the arrow and mine model in half and made no further changes, so they will still be a bit visible at the back.

## enchantment-3d (ITGMania)
A 3D version of the original Enchantment noteskin (a noteskin that's bundled with ITGMania's download). I did not port the entire Enchantment workshop for ITGMania, only the default variant, so here it is.

## enchantment-3d+ (ITGMania)
A two-sided version of "enchantment-3d", for the sake of it looking good with the Twirl mod.
